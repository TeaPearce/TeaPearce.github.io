<!-- ## About ## -->
__About.__ I'm an AI researcher at Microsoft Research in the [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Games](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/deep-reinforcement-learning/) team. I have wide-ranging interest across AI and machine learning, with expertise in uncertainty estimation in neural networks, and imitation learning.

<!-- having worked on  uncertainty estimation in neural networks, Bayesian deep learning, survival analysis, behavioural cloning for video games, the exploration/exploitation dilemma, and algorithmic music composition. -->



<!-- In general my research follows two philosophies; 1) Analysing and designing neural networks from a probabilistic view o -->

<!-- and am particularly drawn to the probabilistic view of learning with neural networks, and building RL agents. -->

__Previous.__ I completed my PhD at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/manufacturing-analytics/), spending time at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), and then did a postdoc at [Tsinghua University](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/). In my previous life I qualified as a Chartered Accountant with Ernst & Young (EY), building forecasting and valuation models for clients across London finance. I also spent one year in Taiwan studying 中文.

__Research Philosophy.__ 1) I adopt a probabilistic view of neural networks to help understand today's algorithms and design those of tomorrow. 2) I believe that RL, with it's mix of sequential and interactive learning, is the correct setting to be studiying to make long-term progress in AI.

__Get in Touch.__ If you'd like to chat about research, collaborating together, or other opportunities, reach me via email at $x$@microsoft.com, where, $x=\text{t-timpearce}$.

<!-- where my research explored how to get better uncertainty estimates from deep neural networks. I continued to explore this in my Postdoc at [Tsinghua University](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), where I also began building behavioural  -->

<!-- In particular focusing on ensembling methods, and priors in Bayesian neural networks.  -->

<!-- I'm a 4th year engineering PhD at the University of Cambridge, having spent time at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing_Institute).  -->

<!-- I completed an internship in reinforcement learning at [PROWLER.io/Secondmind](https://www.secondmind.ai/) and in causal ML at [FDL](https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/) (NASA research accelerator). -->
