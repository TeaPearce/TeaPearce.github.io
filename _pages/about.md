<!-- ## About ## -->
I'm a researcher at Microsoft Research in the [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Games](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/deep-reinforcement-learning/) team. I have wide ranging interest across AI and machine learning, with deep expertise in uncertainty estimation in neural networks, and imitation learning.

<!-- having worked on  uncertainty estimation in neural networks, Bayesian deep learning, survival analysis, behavioural cloning for video games, the exploration/exploitation dilemma, and algorithmic music composition. -->

__Research Philosophy.__ I adopt a probabilistic view of neural networks to help better understand and improve today's algorithms. I believe that the setting considered in RL -- sequential decisions with a mix of offline and online learning -- is the right one to be studying to make long-term progress in AI.

<!-- In general my research follows two philosophies; 1) Analysing and designing neural networks from a probabilistic view o -->

<!-- and am particularly drawn to the probabilistic view of learning with neural networks, and building RL agents. -->

__Previous.__ I completed my PhD at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/manufacturing-analytics/), spending time at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), and did a postdoc at [Tsinghua University](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/). In my previous life I trained as a Chartered Accountant with Ernst & Young (EY). I built forecasting and valuation models for clients across London finance.

<!-- where my research explored how to get better uncertainty estimates from deep neural networks. I continued to explore this in my Postdoc at [Tsinghua University](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), where I also began building behavioural  -->

<!-- In particular focusing on ensembling methods, and priors in Bayesian neural networks.  -->

<!-- I'm a 4th year engineering PhD at the University of Cambridge, having spent time at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing_Institute).  -->

<!-- I completed an internship in reinforcement learning at [PROWLER.io/Secondmind](https://www.secondmind.ai/) and in causal ML at [FDL](https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/) (NASA research accelerator). -->
