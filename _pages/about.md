<!-- ## About ## -->
__About.__ I'm an AI researcher with wide-ranging interest across AI and machine learning. I am based at Microsoft Research in the [Game Intelligence](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/deep-reinforcement-learning/) team. 

__Previous.__ I completed my PhD at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/supply-chain-ai-lab/), spending time at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), and then did a postdoc at [Tsinghua University](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/). In my previous life I qualified as a Chartered Accountant with Ernst & Young (EY), building forecasting and valuation models for clients across London finance. I also spent one year in Taiwan studying ‰∏≠Êñá.

__Research.__
I have deep expertise in _imitation learning_, _world modeling_, _generative modeling_, and _uncertainty estimation_. Whilst my PhD centered around Bayesian deep learning (e.g. [ensembling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05546) and [priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06076)), recently I have focused on applying ideas from generative modeling to RL-type settings (e.g. [using diffusion to imitate humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10677)). My [work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04258) on behavioral cloning for video games has been [widely shared](https://youtu.be/UvoyMGxN89Y?si=4vIkctZ3EijukYJj).

My research aims to build and understand AI systems that are scalable, robust and human-like. My philosophy incorporates several elements.
1) I adopt a probabilistic view of neural networks to help understand today's algorithms and design those of tomorrow. 2) I believe that the agent-environment framework, with sequential decisions and interactive learning, is the correct setting to be studying to make long-term progress in AI. 3) My research places equal weighting on theory and empirics.

__Get in Touch.__ If you'd like to chat about research, collaborating together, or other opportunities, reach me via email at $x$@microsoft.com, where, $x=\text{tim.pearce}$. I'm more active on Twitter than here, so for up-to-date news, [follow me](https://twitter.com/Tea_Pearce).

__Outreach.__ I set aside one hour each week to support underrepresented groups doing AI research (in any sense; age, finances, gender, nationality, race  etc). I'm happy to provide project advice, research talks, career chats, adhoc teaching... or anything else that is helpful. Reach out at the above email ‚ò∫Ô∏è.
