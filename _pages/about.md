<!-- ## About ## -->
__About.__ I'm an AI researcher with wide-ranging interest across AI and machine learning. I have particular expertise in imitation learning, generative modeling, and uncertainty estimation in neural networks. I'm currently based at Microsoft Research in the [Game Intelligence team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/deep-reinforcement-learning/) team.

__Previous.__ I completed my PhD at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/supply-chain-ai-lab/), spending time at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), and then did a postdoc at [Tsinghua University](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/). In my previous life I qualified as a Chartered Accountant with Ernst & Young (EY), building forecasting and valuation models for clients across London finance. I also spent one year in Taiwan studying 中文.

__Research Philosophy.__ 1) I adopt a probabilistic view of neural networks to help understand today's algorithms and design those of tomorrow. 2) I believe that the agent-environment framework, with sequential decisions and interactive learning, is the correct setting to be studying to make long-term progress in AI. 3) My research generally places roughly equal weighting on theory and empirics.

__Get in Touch.__ If you'd like to chat about research, collaborating together, or other opportunities, reach me via email at $x$@microsoft.com, where, $x=\text{tim.pearce}$. I'm more active on Twitter than here, so for up-to-date news, [follow me](https://twitter.com/Tea_Pearce).

__Outreach.__ I set aside one hour each week to support underrepresented groups doing AI research (in any sense; age, finances, gender, nationality, race  etc). I'm happy to provide project advice, research talks, career chats, adhoc teaching... or anything else that is helpful. Reach out at the above email ☺️.
