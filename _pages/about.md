## About ##
I'm a 4th year engineering PhD at the University of Cambridge, having spent time at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing_Institute). 

My research has explored how to get better uncertainty estimates from deep neural networks. In particular focusing on ensembling methods, and priors in Bayesian neural networks.

I completed an internship in reinforcement learning at [PROWLER.io](https://www.prowler.io/) and in causal ML at [FDL](https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/) (NASA research accelerator).
