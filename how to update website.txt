note to remind myself how to update website, since I do it so rarely I forget each time!


update stuff in this folder

when do git push, need to create personal access token
https://collabnix.com/how-to-fix-support-for-password-authentication-was-removed-error-in-github/

use this when it asks for password
(Might to push again to get it to call up, username is TeaPearce)


_variables.scss -- for color variables etc
_sidebar.scss -- to get rid of profile image rounding
navigation.yml -- edit this for top bar headers
_config.yml changes general stuff like name

most stuff I'll want to edit in future is under _pages/

also useful to check this
